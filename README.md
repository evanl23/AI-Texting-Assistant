# AI-Texting-Assistant
This repository contains code for a personal assistant that proactively reminds students of tasks and deadlines, purely through text. This is part of my contributions towards a startup, TextMarley, founded by myself and two other students at BU, with hopes of helping every college student simplify their reminder system and centralize to-dos.
